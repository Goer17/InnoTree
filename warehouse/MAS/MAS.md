# Enhancing Coordination in Decentralized Multi-Agent Systems using Graph Neural Networks

## Abstract

The development of robust and efficient multi-agent systems (MAS) is critical for applications requiring decentralized decision-making and coordination. This research proposes a novel communication protocol integrating Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) to optimize coordination in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). By utilizing GNNs to model inter-agent communications dynamically and HRL for handling complex tasks through multi-level subgoals, this framework aims to address challenges such as non-stationarity and scalability inherent in decentralized MAS setups.

## Hypothesis

The integration of GNNs for relational modeling among agents, coupled with HRL's multi-level decision-making framework, will significantly enhance the coordination and scalability of decentralized MARL systems. This approach is hypothesized to reduce issues related to non-stationarity by allowing agents to effectively communicate and adapt to changing environments while pursuing complex, cohesive tasks.

## Experiment Design

1. **Model Architecture Design**: Develop a GNN-based architecture to facilitate communication and relational understanding between agents. Implement HRL components to manage task hierarchies with timed subgoals for adaptive learning[4][6].
2. **Simulation Environment Setup**: Utilize benchmark environments for MARL, such as autonomous vehicles or smart grids, to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework[2][5].
3. **Performance Metrics and Evaluation**: Evaluate the framework's efficacy by measuring improvements in task completion time, coordination efficiency, and adaptiveness to environment changes compared to existing methodologies[1][3].
4. **Real-world Application Testing**: Conduct trials in practical settings like autonomous driving simulations or distributed sensor networks to validate the robustness of the proposed MARL framework[5].

Through this approach, the research aims to advance the state-of-the-art in MARL by fostering more resilient and efficient multi-agent systems capable of tackling real-world challenges.
