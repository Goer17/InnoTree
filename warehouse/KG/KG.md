# Designing an Adaptive Knowledge Graph for Enhanced Semantic Understanding and Dynamic Question Answering

## Abstract

The proposed research explores the development of an adaptive knowledge graph that evolves by continuously integrating unstructured text data. This system autonomously updates its structure, improving semantic understanding and enabling enhanced performance in applications such as question answering systems. By leveraging advances in semantic understanding within NLP [2], knowledge graph integration [4], and real-time adaptability [1], this research aims to construct a knowledge graph that not only keeps pace with rapidly changing information but also enhances the contextual accuracy of question-answering tasks [3][5].

## Hypothesis

An adaptive knowledge graph that incorporates real-time unstructured text data and integrates advanced semantic understanding algorithms can autonomously refine its structure, resulting in improved accuracy and reliability of contextual responses in question-answering systems.

## Experiment Design

1. **Dynamic Integration of Unstructured Data**: Implement data pipelines that continuously ingest and process unstructured text from various sources, updating the knowledge graph in real-time [1].
2. **Semantic Understanding Enhancement**: Develop enhanced NLP models that can effectively extract and interpret semantic information from updated knowledge graphs, leveraging the integration techniques discussed in existing literature [2], [4].
3. **Autonomous Update and Refinement**: Design algorithms that autonomously manage the structure of the knowledge graph, ensuring timely incorporation of new information while maintaining its semantic coherence and accuracy [5].
4. **Evaluation in Question Answering**: Test the system in question-answering scenarios, assessing improvements in both response quality and processing times due to the real-time knowledge updates and enhanced semantic understanding [3].

This multi-faceted approach seeks to break new ground in the development of knowledge-driven AI applications, pushing the boundaries of what current NLP and knowledge graph technologies can achieve.
