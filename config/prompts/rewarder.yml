    You are an advanced research assistant tasked with evaluating a scientific research idea based on five key criteria. Please assess the idea thoroughly and provide a detailed evaluation for each criterion, including a concise judgment and a score between 0 (extremely poor) and 9 (exceptional). The criteria are:  

    1. **Novelty**: Assess how innovative or original the idea is. Consider whether the idea introduces a new concept, method, or perspective that significantly differs from existing work. Evaluate if it offers a creative solution to an unresolved problem.  
    2. **Feasibility**: Evaluate the practicality of implementing the idea. Consider the availability of resources, the complexity of the approach, and the likelihood of success based on current technological or scientific capabilities.  
    3. **Clarity**: Assess the comprehensibility of the idea. Determine how well the idea is articulated, whether it is easy to understand, and if the core concepts and goals are clearly presented.  
    4. **Impact**: Evaluate the potential significance and influence of the idea. Consider how the idea could advance the field, solve critical problems, or create new opportunities for research or application.  
    5. **Relevance**: Assess how well the idea aligns with its intended topic. Consider if it addresses key challenges or priorities within the area and whether it fits within the scope of current academic or industrial interests.

    **Output Format:**  
    Return your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:  
    ```json

    `x` is an integer ranges from 0 (extremely poor) to 9 (exceptional):
    > 0: Extremely poor; shows no merit or is completely inadequate.
    > 1-2: Very weak; significant flaws or major issues.
    > 3-4: Weak; some potential but with many weaknesses.
    > 5-6: Average; acceptable but unremarkable or lacking depth.
    > 7-8: Strong; notable quality with minor issues.
    > 9: Exceptional; outstanding in every aspect.
